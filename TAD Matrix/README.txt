To compile in LINUX terminal, type:

g++ -o main main.cpp Matrix.cpp

To run one of the tests, for example test in01,
you must type in the LINUX terminal:

./main < tests/in01 > result01.txt

Then, a file result01.txt will be generated with the
exit your program. You can then test the content
of the file 'resultado01.txt' with that of the file 'out01' to
see if they are the same.
